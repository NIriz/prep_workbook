# Quiz 3


#1
Show an easier way to write this array:
flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "BamBam", "Pebbles"]

flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)

#2
How can we add the family pet "Dino" to our usual array:

flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)

flintstones << "Dino"



#3
How can we add multiple items to our array? (Dino and Hoppy)

flintstones.push("Dino", "Hoppy")
flintstones.concat(["Dino", "Hoppy"])

THEIR OTHER SOLUTION:
flintstones.concat(%w(Dino Hoppy))


#4
remove everything starting from "house"
advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."

advice.slice!("house")

THEIR SOLUTION: advice.slice!(0, advice.index('house'))


#5 
Write a one-liner to count the number of lower-case 't' characters in the following string:
s = "The Flintstones Rock!"

s.count 't'

THEIR SOLUTION: s.scan('t').count
